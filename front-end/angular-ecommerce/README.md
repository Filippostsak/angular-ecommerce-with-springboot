This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# First step-create the connection with the back-end

Created the service, the common and the first component which fetches data from the back end. Finally added a placeholder image. Later i will fetch the images dynamically.
